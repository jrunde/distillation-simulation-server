        	The primary pedagogical function of the game is to provide conversational space for students to explore issues of sustainability. On its own, the game does not "teach" any concepts. It is through discussion about the features and feedback of the game that learning can and should happen. As such, the game has been designed to promote both large and small group discussion. Teachers using the game in their classrooms may choose to have pre-game discussions to tune student attention to important aspects of the ecological and economic system they will encounter in the game, mid-game discussions about various strategies and evidence for the effectiveness of those strategies, and post-game discussions either to summarize what students experienced or to launch further study.
            <br />
        	<br />
        	Because the game is designed to be a platform for discussion rather than a stand-alone instructional tool, it has great flexibility in how and in what classrooms it can be used. The various options in the game allow it to be used in a range of classrooms: from environmental science to economics to business to agriculture. Depending on the options that are enabled, the game addresses a host of National and State Standards. Specifically the game is consistent with the Next Generation Science Standards. It addresses the following Cross Cutting Concepts and Scientific Practices:
