        	The Fields of Fuel game is the result of a multidisciplinary collaboration that integrates researchers from the UW Department of Curriculum and Instruction, Department of Computer Sciences, Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center (GLBRC), and Wisconsin Institute for Discovery (WID). This collaboration is producing a multiplayer, web-based simulation game designed to educate players about the economic and environmental tradeoffs associated with the development of sustainable bioenergy cropping systems. This game combines expertise from computer scientists, biofuel researchers and education scholars to create a tool that is both educational and scientifically accurate.<br />
        	<br />
        In this game, players - both students and the public - take on the role of farmers working to sustainably grow crops to produce energy resources, earn income and improve ecosystem services. In doing so, players engage in sophisticated systems-level thinking and learn about:<br />
			<ul>
       		   <li>Ecological and economic aspects of sustainability</li>
       		   <li>Short and long term dynamics of the sustainable systems</li>
       		   <li>Local and global impacts of individual farmer management decisions</li>
   			</ul>
        Interacting with and making sense of game dynamics demonstrates the complexity involved with the sustainable production of bioenergy crops and helps to communicate current research more authentically than the traditional expository approaches used in schools. This collaboration also ties into a number of other projects, including the development of a decision support tool to evaluate policy decisions around biofuels production, as well as an online role playing game designed to crowdsource ecological and economic interactions in northern Wisconsin.<br />
