        <p>
        	The ongoing development of the Fields of Fuel game is directed primarily by a set of goals that relate to how the game is intended to be used in a classroom setting and what we envision players taking away from the game. The objectives we would like people to take away from playing the game are as follows:
        	<br />
        	<ol>
        		<li>Understand the basic dimensions of sustainable biofuel production.</li>
        		<li>Understand the general ecological and economic mechanisms of agricultural systems.</li>
        		<li>Identify and recognize the differences between long and short term trends and related management decisions.</li>
				<li>Understand how individual farmer management decisions affect local economic and ecological outcomes.</li>
				<li>Understand how global environmental and economic effects emerge from individual decisions.</li>
        	</ol>
        	<br />
        While the game mechanics themselves help to facilitate the reasoning process necessary to reach these goals, the game is most effective when used to engender discussion between players around these goals.
        	<br />
        	<br />
        	<h2>Game goals:</h2> The game can be played to maximize 1) overall sustainability 2) income 3) energy production 4) environmental score. Pursuing each score requires different strategies and reveals unexpected consequences. The game moderator or group vote can determine the game goal.
            <br />
        	<br />
        	<h2>Discussion Points:</h2>
        	<ol>
          		<li>After first planting – Ask people what they planted and why.</li>
          		<li>Discussion of management strategies – Touch on the idea that different people could be doing different things and could have different reasons for doing those things.</li>
          		<li>After first round wrap up – Is there anything that the group finds surprising?</li>
          		<li>Let them play for a few rounds.</li>
          		<li>After maybe 3rd/4th round wrap up – What are people noticing? Bring up the underlying components that play into overall score and discuss the components of the sustainability score. Are people noticing trends? Who is winning and why? – economic vs ecological sustainability.</li>
          		<li>Conversation about evidence – What evidence are people using to make claims about changes in sustainability? This would get folded into the other conversations and pushes on what sources of info will help us unpack the ecological mechanism piece in a nice way.</li>
          		<li>Who is changing their crops and/or management decisions and who is keeping things the same? Have people talked about which one they are doing and why? What information are they using to make those decisions?</li>
          		<li>Unpacking ecological mechanisms – Look at people who are doing really well and ask them what they are doing.</li>
          		<li>Farm vs. world view trends – After some round when round wrap up screen is up, point to a particular global trend and ask where that trend is coming from. Have each group report their farm level trend. Put this information up on the board and talk about how it contributes to the overall trend.</li>
          		<li>Pose/Consider the following questions: Can you have short vs. long term trends conversation before the end of the game? How would you change your strategy to make it more sustainable? Is this enough information to help you decide? How do you evaluate if this is a long term sustainable management decision?</li>
        	</ol>
        	<br />
        	A different way to play the game and talk about it: how can we as a group collectively achieve the goal.
